# LCABrother
This web application was designed to serve my Lambda Chi Alpha chapter operations. However, it is made such that any greek organization, club, or otherwise, can use to track member involvement, dates, contact information, etc.

# Features
- Service Event Logging (Community Service)
- Involvement Tracking (Member participation of organization events)
- Contact Info (List of information for every member)
- Event Guest Lists (Generate guest list for events, parties, etc.)
- Tasks (Assign tasks to members, set due dates, track progress)
- Calendar (Categorized, can generate guest list or attendance, and can count towards involvement tracking)
- Academics (Track academics for each member, automatically calculate status (good,suspension) based on grades)
- Roles & Permission (Can assign various roles/permissions for each member)
- Totals (Track the progress of the organization; total service hours, money donated, etc.)
- And maybe more that I'm forgetting. ;)

# Info
As stated in the intro, this was designed specifically for my fraternity chapter. Therefore, it would require some alterations to suit your chapter or organization. However, it is a much more affordable option compared to similar systems. I do not plan to offer any support or resolve any of the outstanding issues in this repo. Feel free to fork and resolve any if you so desire to use this project for your own organization.
It is writtin in Laravel, using a number of nifty packages.
